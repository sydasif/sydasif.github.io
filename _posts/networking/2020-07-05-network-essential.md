## What is a network?
A computer network is two or more computers to share resources. A network is a collection of computers, servers, network devices, peripherals, or other devices connected to one another to allow the sharing of data.

## Local Area Network

A local area network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home. A LAN can be small or large, ranging from a home network with one user to an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices in an office or building.

## Wide Area Network

A wide area network (WAN) is a network that extends over a large or different geographical area for the primary purpose of computer networking. In its simplest form, a WAN is a collection of LANs or other networks that communicate with one another.

## Topologies

A physical and logical way to connect network devices to create a network layout. Main types of network topologies are below:

  1. Bus topology
  2. Ring topology
  3. Star topology
  4. Mesh topology.

## Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) Cable

UTP cable working length is 100 meters, also called attenuation length. Straight through UTP is used for dissimilar devices like PC and switch. Cross over UTP cable is used for similar devices like a switch to switch. Rollover cable is used for console connectivity.

## Megabits per second (Mbps)

Mbps is a unit of measurement for bandwidth and throughput on a network.
