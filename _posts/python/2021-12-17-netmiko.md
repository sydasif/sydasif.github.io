## What is Netmiko?
**Netmiko** is a multi-vendor library to simplify Paramiko SSH connections to network devices. Netmiko supports a wide range of devices. These devices fall into three categories, see [supported platforms](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko/blob/develop/PLATFORMS.md) on Github.

### Library Purpose

Netmiko simplifies SSH management to network devices. The purposes of this library are the following:

- Successfully establish an SSH connection to the device.
- Simplify the execution, retrieval, and formatting of show commands.
- Simplify the execution of configuration commands.
- Provide a (relatively) uniform API for interacting with devices.

To install netmiko simply use pip for installation.

`pip install netmiko`

Netmiko has the following requirements (which pip will install for you)

- Paramiko >= 2.4.3
- scp >= 0.13.2
- pyserial
- textfsm

We will use our previous topology as below:

[Lab Configuration]({% post_url python/2021-11-29-telnetlib %}) same as previous.

### Getting Started

Import "ConnectHandler" from the Netmiko library.

#### Switch

```py
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

# Create a dictionary for a particular device
S1 = {
 'device_type': 'cisco_ios',
 'ip': '192.168.10.10',
 'username': 'admin',
 'password': 'cisco',
 'secret' : 'cisco',
}

'''calling the ConnectHandler Library [**S1] means telling
python to consider the contents of the dictionary as key value pairs
instead of single elements.'''

net_connect = ConnectHandler(**S1)
net_connect.enable()  # device enable mode

# Sending a command in to the switch --->
output = net_connect.send_command("show ip int br")
print(output)
```

#### Router

```py
# Config_commands sample
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

R1 = {
    'ip':   '192.168.10.11',
    'username': 'admin',
    'password': 'cisco',
    'secret' : 'cisco',
    'device_type': 'cisco_ios',
}

net_connect = ConnectHandler(**R1)
net_connect.enable()  # device enable mode

#Execute configuration change commands
#(will automatically enter into config mode)
config_commands = [ 'int lo0',
                    'ip add 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255',
                    'no shut' ]
output = net_connect.send_config_set(config_commands)
print(output)
```

### Sending commands

Netmiko has several ways to send commands:

- send_command - send one command
- send_config_set - send list of commands or command in configuration mode
- send_config_from_file - send commands from the file (uses send_config_set method inside)
- send_command_timing - send command and wait for the output based on timer

### Netmiko and TextFSM

In Netmiko 2.0.0 (December 2017), added support for direct TextFSM integration particularly for [ntc-templates](https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-templates).

Simply stated, it allows you to take unstructured data and convert it to structured data. Or worded differently, it takes a block of text and converts it to lists and dictionaries (or some combination thereof). See more about [TextFSM here](https://pynet.twb-tech.com/blog/netmiko-and-textfsm.html).
